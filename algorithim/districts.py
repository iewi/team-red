'''

this module creates a district out of tracts. it contains two main methods:
generic_redistrict - re-district Maryland using a default start
specific_redistrict - given a starting tract, re-district Maryland

and two 'helper' methods:
_take_tract - remove a tract from available_tracts, and return false if that fails
_create_district - given a starting tract, create a congressional district

ISSUES
fragments - after creating most districts, only a few remain. they are
            unsuitable for another district, being possibly non-adjacent
            and/or not having enough population to make another one

validity - check the resulting districts for population parity. if not
           within a certain margin of error, discard this districting

infinite loop - if no adjacent tracts are available, create_district
                will loop forever

number of districts - Maryland is only assigned 8 congressional districts,
                      but this (as currently implemented) may create more
                      or fewer. should be easy to fix (maybe)
