'''

this module creates a district out of tracts. it contains two main methods:
generic_redistrict - re-district Maryland using a default start
specific_redistrict - given a starting tract, re-district Maryland

and five 'helper' methods:
_take_tract - remove a tract from available_tracts, and return false if that fails
_density - returns the proportion of available adjacent tracts to total adjacent tracts
_create_district - given a starting tract, create a congressional district
_sanitize_districts - changes a district object to json
_test_redistrict - redistricts part of MD using two districts

ISSUES
fragments - after creating most districts, only a few remain. they are
            unsuitable for another district, being possibly non-adjacent
            and/or not having enough population to make another one

run out of tracts - if there are no unused tracts in the adjacency queue,
                    an error will be thrown. shouldn't be hard to fix.

validity - check the resulting districts for population parity. if not
           within a certain margin of error, discard this districting

infinite loop - if no adjacent tracts are available, create_district
                will loop forever

number of districts - Maryland is only assigned 8 congressional districts,
                      but this (as currently implemented) may create more
                      or fewer. should be easy to fix (maybe)

density method - should maybe go in the tract class

sanitize_districts method - should maybe go in the district class
